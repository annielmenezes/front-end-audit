Front-end Audit
===============

> Use this document as a basis for outlining and planning your front-end build.

You can initially fill this out *before* the build of your front-end, and then update it as you move through to have an at-a-glance list of information that you can constantly evaluate.

Info
----

> Name, URL, additional site-specific info.

- **Site**: [Site Name]
- **URL**: http://www.example.com

Browser Support
---------------

> What browsers will the site support?

Features
--------

> What specific features do you want? (Is the site responsive?, etc.)

Tools
-----

> Any tools or libraries that you want to use or research.

Icons
-----

> What icons will you need?

CSS Architecture
----------------

> How will your CSS be structured? What modules? What framework?

You can build this section out based on looking at the design or wireframes, and then update and document the modules that you actually build. This provides a place for you to evaluate your CSS structure as you build out the front-end. Ultimately, you should move this into a styleguide that exists alongside the project. However, this is a great way to document and evaluate your front-end structure as you go.

Notes & Ideas
-------------

> Any and all notes or ideas.

Issues
------

> Any front-end issues that you need to document.

Is there an issue with your CSS architecture? Is the site not performant?

**Note**: If your working on a team, GitHub Issues would be a suitable replacement for this section.

Log
---

> Any sticking points or things that you want to log.

Generally, how did you solve the issues from above. This is a great way to build a case study to retrospectively look at the problems you found and ultimately solved in your front-end build.
